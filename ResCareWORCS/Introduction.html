<p class="rvps4"><span class="rvts8">By using a HIPAA compliant secure web system it can be accessed from anywhere a web connection is available. The ResCareWORCS System creates an easy user-friendly environment for career counselor/coaches, employment specialists, and program management to conduct daily business and manage the overall project performance, while tracking daily, monthly, and yearly program goals to manage performance and outcomes. By using a creative flow pattern and unique identification system, the ResCareWORCs database links customers with activities, e.g. training, support services, ITAs, OJTs, vouchers, payments, and related funding sources. While providing a distinctive document management system built in to allow for uploading and retaining case information, giving you an unsurpassed quality control system.</span></p>
<p class="rvps4"><span class="rvts8">For purposes of the North TX contract, this system will be used to document budgets and expenditures related to Individual Training Accounts (ITAs), OJTs, Support Services, and WEP (Work Experience Placements). &nbsp;It is designed to calculate these disbursements as it maintains a real-time balance of funds obligated, expended, de-obligated and refunded. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps4"><span class="rvts8">In short, this system is configured to meet the needs of this project. &nbsp;Of course, data is not useful without the ability to extract and use the information, which is why we develop unique reports within the system to meet the requirements of the project. This analytical ability can be used for past trends and advanced planning for future spending.</span></p>
